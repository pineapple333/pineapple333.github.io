1.Push branch to remote:
  git push -u <remote name> <local branch name>
2.If we're in another branch and want to merge the branch with 
'master' then:
  git checkout master
  git pull origin master
  git branch --merged
  git merge <the name of a branch we want to merge with the 'master'>
  git push origin master
3. Deleting a branch:
  git branch --merged
  git branch -d <the name of the branch we want to delete>
  git branch -a - to watch all branches
  git push origin --delete <the name of the remote branch we want to 
delete>
